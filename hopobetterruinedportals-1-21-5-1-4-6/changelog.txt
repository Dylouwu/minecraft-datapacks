---I don't feel so good--- 2/12/2022
♦ If you play with the pack, you know that you can find a zombified piglin in the portals, but the problem is that they can despawn if it past lots of days in minecraft, only if you add a nametag you can avoid this but.
Added the "PersistenceRequired" tag it will not despawn the poor piglin.
